# cat

this is part of a series of small repos i have to test out ideas i have about text editing/note taking/etc. _the ultimate yak._

the others live in a dir called `trashbarge`.

## building:

```sh
git clone ssh://github.com:nsfmc/cat
pushd cat
yarn
```

then in one terminal

    yarn watch

and in another terminal

    yarn electron

### notes

in its current state, this is a working electron + webpack 4, babel 7 setup (although far from optimized)
